# AlcoholConsumptionRates
MATLAB code to process a Google Sheet database into visualizations

You'll need to run the .mlx in MATLAB to see a Jupyter Notebook style presentation of the code. Else, that same code is visible without that formatting, in the other file.

(Older versions of the code were based on consumption per guest, whereas the current version takes data for consumption per guest per hour, to capture varience in event length)
